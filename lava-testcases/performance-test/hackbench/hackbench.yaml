  # Sets the amount of data to send in each message

  LOOPS: "100"
  # Defines how many groups of senders and receivers should be started

  # Defines how many file descriptors each child should use.  Note that the
  # effective number will be twice the amount you set here, as the sender
  # and receiver children will each open the given amount of file descriptors.

  # Sends the data via a pipe instead of the socket (default)
  PIPE: "false"
  # Each sender/receiver child will be a POSIX thread of the parent.
